# Youtube-DL Web UI

This repository is the React Web application created to interact with the [backend application](https://github.com/youtubedl-web/backend). It's a very simple project created to ease the work needed to download an MP3 audio file from that funny highlights video from your favorite streamer.

## Get started

Since this repository holds the frontend code, you will also need to [run the backend](https://github.com/youtubedl-web/backend/blob/master/README.md#get-started).

Clone the repository and install all dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/youtubedl-web/webui
cd webui && yarn install
```

The only step remaining is a .env file (here's an example .env file [here](https://github.com/youtubedl-web/webui/blob/master/.env.example)). Don't forget it should be set up according to the values from the backend's configuration file (`config.json`)

Start the Web UI and have fun!
```
yarn start
```
