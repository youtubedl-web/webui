# Youtube-DL Web UI

This repository is the React Web application created to interact with the [backend application](https://github.com/youtubedl-web/backend). It's a very simple project created to ease the work needed to download an MP3 audio file from that funny highlights video from your favorite streamer.

**DISCLAIMER**: Neither do I or any contributors endorse piracy and any way of business with this applications, be it the Web UI or the Backend. This project was made for pure practice and at the same time it's a tool I use myself to download entertainment content: stream highlights, memes and such. Therefore, under no circumstance do I hold accountability the consequences of prohibited use of this project.
